SCALING
==============
All weapons have scaling values, based off the previous stats (Nominally Magic, Melee, and Ranged)
Scaling increases the amount of attacks each weapon does whenever fired, effectively doubling/tripling
damage output with each value. Stats can be increased without the bonfire shop by opening the console
and typing "(stat) (value)", for example, I can make my melee stat 10 by typing 'melee 10'.

Scaling is not balanced, high values WILL obliterate most enemies.
Scaling is MUCH more effective with physical weapons rather than magical.
